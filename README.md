I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering](https://abe.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I specialize in **Computational Engineering for Digital Precision Agriculture**. My research focuses on using **advanced data analytics** and **AI algorithms**â€”ranging from simple models to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques to process and interpret multi-source sensor data. These data streams include:  
- **Remotely sensed imagery** (leveraging free and open-access platforms),  
- **Robotics sensing data** (collected using the Farm-ng Amiga platform), and  
- **Machine sensing** (from vision cameras mounted on agricultural equipment).  

I am dedicated to developing data-driven decision support tools that empower farmers and stakeholders to make informed decisions, whether for seasonal management, understanding legacy effects, or enabling near real-time interventions. By bridging the gap between technology and agriculture, our work aims to create innovative, practical, and impactful solutions for the future of farming.
